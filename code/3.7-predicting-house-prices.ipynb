    "Here's what you should take away from this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression is done using different loss functions from classification; Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a commonly used loss function for \n",
    "regression.\n",
    "* Similarly, evaluation metrics to be used for regression differ from those used for classification; naturally the concept of \"accuracy\" \n",
    "does not apply for regression. A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "* When features in the input data have values in different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently as a preprocessing step.\n",
    "* When there is little data available, using K-Fold validation is a great way to reliably evaluate a model.\n",
    "* When little training data is available, it is preferable to use a small network with very few hidden layers (typically only one or two), \n",
    "in order to avoid severe overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example concludes our series of three introductory practical examples. You are now able to handle common types of problems with vector data input:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary (2-class) classification.\n",
    "* Multi-class, single-label classification.\n",
    "* Scalar regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, you will acquire a more formal understanding of some of the concepts you have encountered in these first examples, \n",
    "such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and overfitting."
